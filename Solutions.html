		<div class="col-12">
			<p>Large scale of capital: Having strong economic potential, capital is greater than 100 billion dong, so it can quickly change and be exposed to the advanced science and technology in the world.</p>
The total number of employees is greater than 300 people. <br>
Accounting for minority (5%) of the total number of enterprises in Vietnam, but play a key role in the economy of the country. Create a large amount of jobs and take responsibility for boosting the economy. <br>
Being a person "standing at the nose to bear the pole", heavily influenced in each crisis to stabilize the economy. <br>

			<p ><h4>The unreasonable job analysis leads to the lack of practicality and difficulty in quality control</h4></p>
			<p  >Any business owner knows that the planned plan and strategy will be implemented more effectively when the manager knows how to assign and arrange the tasks for each employee in the most reasonable way. However, with a large number of employees (more than 300 people), the effective division of work is not easy, not to mention monitoring the effectiveness of the work that employees bring. With the number of employees from a few tens to a few hundred people, if done by hand, it will take a lot of human time and effort.</p>

			<h4>Difficulty in planning human resources</h4>
		<p>Despite being a large enterprise, there are very few units that actively plan human resources in the long-term, ... to forecast demand. The determination of excess or shortage of labor is also often determined by each department based on the current workload, not the involvement of the human resources department.</p>
		<p>Consequently, the management board lacks the basis to propose recruitment strategies, administration as well as budget planning for salary and bonus payment ... affecting governance. Not to mention, once you do not know the human resources of the company, other strategies will be difficult to implement and achieve the desired results.</p>
            <h4>Difficulty in building and managing processes</h4>
            <p>Some large businesses today still keep the habit of setting up a paper-based process. This action brings many shortcomings and creates a lot of barriers to implementation. On the other hand, it is difficult for the administrator to know at which processing step a job is being delayed, which is the frequent cause of the problems. Therefore, the process building, empowering all levels of management, organization, and staff hierarchy to coordinate work effectively is essential at this time.
		Once the human resources cannot be planned, the recruitment and training of the successor team will fall into a deadlock. </p>

		<h4>Difficulty in recruiting and training the successor team</h4>
		<p>In fact, in many large enterprises, due to the low awareness and management level, after implementing the recruitment process, these businesses often end the recruitment process without knowing the effectiveness of the staff. What is this recruitment wave, have you achieved the goal of the recruitment process…. Therefore, the work to evaluate the effectiveness of the selection work is only conducted by about 35% of enterprises.</p>
		<h4>It is difficult to meet employees' needs for remuneration policies</h4>
		<p>Although large enterprises have good recruiting brands, they will inevitably be competitive by businesses of the same size. Therefore, in order to attract and retain key personnel, it is extremely important to evaluate experience, qualifications, work history as well as development potential to come up with appropriate remuneration policies.</p>
<p>However, with a large scale, many departments, many quick expenses, the analysis, classification and calculation of salaries, and bonuses for employees still have many errors, and are not rational, leading to a decrease in employee satisfaction. tablets. Moreover, the calculation of salary, bonus, and remuneration for many enterprises is still done manually, leading to an increase in workload for the HR department but the efficiency is not high.</p>
<h4>Difficulty in data management</h4>
<p>
There is too much data to manage in medium and large enterprises, including financial data, human resources, customer information, ... These data are often located in other departments and departments. so they are often scattered and scattered in many places. This means that it is very difficult to control information and data throughout the enterprise. You may miss important information or fail to promptly capture or share urgent information in your business.</p>
